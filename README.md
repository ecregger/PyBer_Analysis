# PyBer_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to review the PyBer dataset and drill-down to the three different city types to analyze their differences in regards to service and fares. 

# What is the data telling us?

## Ride Totals
There is a total of 2,375 rides with over 68% of those rides taking place in urban cities or areas. 

## Driver Totals
There are 2,973 total drivers and 2,405 of them are in urban cities or areas, suburban areas consist of 490 drivers, with rural cities or areas only accounting for 78 drivers. 

## Fares and Averages
In total PyBer has generated $63,538.64 in these cities. Urban cities account for $39,854.38, suburban account for $19,356.33, and rural comes in at only $4,327.93.

While rural areas have the lowest amount of drivers and fares, they have the highest average fare per ride at $34.62 and urban areas have the lowest at $24.52. Drivers in rural areas make the most per ride at $55.48 and urban drivers make the least per ride at $16.57, although they have more competition and much more opportunity. Surburban areas consistently fall in the middle and provide somewhat of a balance between the rural and urban areas. 

# Reccomendations

Judging by the data grouped in these areas and also displayed on the chart, I reccomend:

1.  Recruiting more drivers in both rural and suburban ares to see if this produces more customer opportunities, lowers rates, and increases revenues. 
2.  The rates in urban areas are extremely low and also in high demand. It would be worth testing out a slight increase in fare to see if that affects customer response. 
3.  We are consistently low in the month of January in all areas. So, I suggest testing out a fare decrease in each area to see if that increases the amount of rides and may increase revenue during this time.
